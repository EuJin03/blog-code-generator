    'What is a bigger and better influencer? A bigger influencer simply means more followers or subscribers, but a better influencer means someone who really engages with his/her audience. Nowadays engagement rates are deemed more important than follower counts.',

    'How is engagement rate calculated?',
  'pages.articles.organically-increase-follower.paragraph-3':
    'Engagement rate is calculated based on the total actions people have taken when they saw your post. That means more likes, more comments, more saves, more shares. The more engaging your content is, the more likely your content will be shown to the next follower.',
  'pages.articles.organically-increase-follower.paragraph-4':
    'Simply put, the more engaging your content, the more your content would appear to the next follower and the more likely your profile will appear to a wider audience and thus, more followers!',

    'How do you increase engagement?',

    'Tip 1: End your captions with a question',
  'pages.articles.organically-increase-follower.paragraph-6':
    "What we found when working with a lot of influencers is that if you end your caption with a question, people will likely reply to that. If you're a more serious influencer, you'd want to ask a good question. For example, I'm doing a skincare routine. I'd ask a question “I'm currently using the Clinique turnaround cream but I'm almost finishing! Share what are some of your best night creams and I'd be sure to check them out! Your followers want to help, they want to be heard too. So be sure to ask! We've seen with younger audiences, you could also ask your followers to spam emoji and they'd do it! If you feel like putting in the extra effort, you could do a giveaway by yourself. Comment 3 friends to get a chance to win this or that.",

    'Tip 2: Create carousel post instead of photo post',
  'pages.articles.organically-increase-follower.paragraph-7':
    "If you're an instagrammer, create carousel posting instead of a single photo post. One of the reasons this works is because people are generally curious to see what is in your following image and will want to swipe right. Swiping right and seeing the content to the end is a form of engagement as well. If you're doing a sponsored post, this is especially good if you do not wish to appear too hardsell. If you could add some text to your image, also add arrows and swipe rights and save indicators to get people to swipe right and/or save your post.",

  'pages.articles.organically-increase-follower.paragraph-8':
    'IG/FB/YouTube/TikTok stories are a great way to engage your audience as well. Stories are a way to show behind the scenes, more casual postings throughout your day. There are so many interesting features you could use as well - ask poll questions (it’s MCQ so it’s really no brainer for people to answer), you could also create teaser questions through your stories. I’m giving my boyfriend a surprise today… Ask your audience what they think you should do. Show some answers from your audience, do the most interesting one suggested by your audience and watch your engagement grow. People love an interactive story that they can participate in real time.',

    'Tip 4: Vary up the content sometimes',
  'pages.articles.organically-increase-follower.paragraph-9':
    'If your content is often just about you, be sure to also share some post every now and again about your sibling, parent or teacher. If your content is always happy, sometimes tell them a sad story. Change it up a little and give it a little variety. These little WTF moments will create intrigue. When your followers see something they don’t expect, they will likely engage with it.',

    'Tip 5: Engage with your community',
  'pages.articles.organically-increase-follower.paragraph-10':
    'The great thing about social media is that it is a two-way communication, unlike a celebrity life of the past. Do respond to comments, and also comment on other people’s postings. Commenting on your follower’s posts from time to time shows that you care about their point of view and you want to be involve. If you have more time, you could also comment on other influencer’s postings. This way, their followers who are reading their comments would be curious and check out your profile too.',
